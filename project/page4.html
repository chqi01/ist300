				<h1>Time to SHINE!!!</h1>
				<p>“Life is a party. Dress like it.” Designers clearly took Lilly Pulitzer’s words to heart for FW17, ensuring that we would have a way to brighten our days, whatever the world decides to throw at us next. The message is this: do not reserve your sparkling pieces for after hours; make the daytime a
little more decadent as well. For inspiration, go to page 20 and our shoot with Cara Delevingne as she takes a quick break from acting and writing to model the season’s shining fashion stars, and explain why she is using her past struggles with self esteem to try and help others via her debut novel. Spreading a little sparkle, you might say.</p>
				

<p>As ever, detail is key across the collection, as cut-outs and scarf ties place focus on the neckline. And it all comes with the ultra-modern twist that you’d expect from a global fashion powerhouse, with the introduction of an oversized paisley print for FW17. It’s an imaginative homage to the eternal appeal of Pucci. </p>


<p>Recent seasons have championed
a ‘dressing down’ approach, as athleisure and streetwear increased their fashion credentials. So how do cool girls dress up these days? An iridescent midi skirt tempered with a pared-back cashmere turtleneck is the 2017 equivalent of sky-high heels and an LBD. Swap vertiginous shoes for slouchy boots or chic slippers.</p>


<p>To tap into the metallic trend with subtlety, substitute one of your
fail-safe pieces for its dazzling
alter ego. A pair of jazzed-up tailored pants adds a fashion-forward edge to your usual workwear, without going all-out Studio 54. Offset their brilliance with metallic micro-detail – a mirrored heel or sparkling accessory will work wonders.</p>


<p>Having worked with designers from Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent in the ’50s, as well as ensuring the well-heeled truly deserved the moniker (Queen Elizabeth II and Marlene Dietrich were just two of his private clients), the late cordwainer Roger Vivier was a footwear genius. Today, under the creative direction of Bruno Frisoni, the Parisian label retains all of its decadent hallmarks – think classic square toes and vintage-feel, jewel-encrusted embellishments. Cool but ladylike, they’ll amp up a blazer, logo tee and jeans combo.
